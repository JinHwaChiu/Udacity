    "\n",
    "In model prediction there are two main sources of errors that a model can suffer from.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Bias\n",
    "Bias due to a model being unable to represent the complexity of the underlying data. __A high Bias model is said to underfit the data.__\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Variance\n",
    "Variance due to a model being overly sensitive to the limited data it has been trained on. __A high Variance model is said to overfit the data.__\n",

    "#### Error due to Bias - Accuracy and Underfitting\n",
    "Bias occurs when a model has enough data but is not complex enough to capture the underlying relationships. As a result, the model consistently and systematically misrepresents the data, leading to low accuracy in prediction. This is known as underfitting. Simply put, bias occurs when we have an inadequate model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example 1\n",
    "An example might be when we have objects that are classified by color and shape, for example easter eggs, but our model can only partition and classify objects by color. It would therefore consistently mislabel future objects--for example labeling rainbows as easter eggs because they are colorful.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example 2\n",
    "Another example would be continuous data that is polynomial in nature, with a model that can only represent linear relationships. In this case it does not matter how much data we feed the model because it cannot represent the underlying relationship. To overcome error from bias, we need a more complex model."

    "##### Error due to Variance - Precision and Overfitting\n",
    "When training a model, we typically use __a limited number of samples__ __from a larger population__. If we repeatedly train a model with randomly selected subsets of data, we would expect its predictons to be different based on the specific examples given to it. Here __variance is a measure of how much the predictions vary for any given test sample.__\n",
    "\n",
    "Some variance is normal, but __too much variance indicates that the model is unable to generalize its predictions to the larger population__. __High sensitivity to the training set is also known as overfitting__, and generally occurs when either the model is too complex or when we do not have enough data to support it.\n",
