    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. **Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000.** This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. **Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners.** Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",

    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "- we can imagine gradient boosting tree algoritm that we are tring to solve a tough problem. we have initial solution, which may be bad, but we know where we are wrong and try to improve it. However, in evey iteration only thing we do is alternating our strategy to correct the mistakes we made in the previous one. when we think it is fininshed, we collect all solutions, then estimate the error in each solution and judge how important it is. Finally, we base on those solutions, whcih may be weak individually, but the combination of those weak solutions work better.these weak solutions, we called \"weak learner\", are simple algorithms which predict at least slightly better than random chance. we use weak learners several times to get several hypotheses, each one refocused on the examples that previous one found difficlut and missclassified.\n",

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "Justification is provided for which model appears to be the best to use given computational cost, model performance, and the characteristics of the data.\n",
    "Your justification is fair, just be sure to revisit this section after fixing up the error in your train_predict function.\n",
    "Student is able to clearly and concisely describe how the optimal model works in layman's terms to someone who is not familiar with machine learning nor has a technical background.\n",
    "Good work! It seems like you covered the most important aspects of Gradient Boosting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Being able to explain a model in simple terms is a really important asset in business, as many of the people you'll be working with won't have the technical background you do. For this reason you should try to get a similar handle on other popular ML models.\n",

    "Overall good work, but you should not be tuning random_state. This hyperparameter is meant only to control randomness inside the data - you should never be tuning it though, as it won't improve the generality of your model.

    "Nice job! Your feature choices are logical and intuitive :+1:\n",
    "Student correctly implements a supervised learning model that makes use of the feature_importances_ attribute. Additionally, student discusses the differences or similarities between the features they considered relevant and the reported relevant features.\n",
    "Great work here! It's fine to miss a couple features in your intuition - that's exactly what we have these feature importance models for.\n",
    "\n",
    "TIPS\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a ton of other methods we can use to extract the feature importances in our data. You might remember some of the simpler univariate methods like SelectKBest and SelectPercentile.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also try more complex methods like Recursive Feature Elimination. This technique recursively cuts out the feature that contributes least to the model, and then re-evaluates the model after the elimination. This process repeats until we have the desired number of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're interested in checking this technique or others, take a look at the posts below\n",

    "Student analyzes the final model's performance when only the top 5 features are used and compares this performance to the optimized model from Question 5.\n",
    "Great work! It's worth mentioning that in instances where we really value training time, we can also elect to try a simpler model. Sometimes reducing the feature space on complex models can result in worse performance and worse training time.\n",
